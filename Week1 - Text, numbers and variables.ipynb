    "In this session we are going to look at how ```python``` handles different types of objects. What are objects? Well, in a nutshell the data that we let python loose on. Objects can be text, numbers or more exotic things as we'll see. When we write programs we generally want to manipulate some **objects**. In the python world objects have different **types**. The type of an object allows python to decide what can be done with that object. So in this section we'll look at some of the different types of objects; specifically we'll look at text (type ```string``` i.e. strings of characters), numbers (types ```int```, ```long```, ```float``` and ```complex```) and Booleans (type ```bool```). We'll also look at some basic **operators** which are the things that indicate a particular operation we'd like to carry out (e.g. + is the operator for addition, just as it is in maths).\n",

    "There are a few differences between 2.x and 3.x versions of python here but they's mostly minimal and so if you keep this up and transition to 3.x python in the future you should be able to adjust without any great issues."

You can use single or double quotes and sometimes you may have good reason to use one and not the other. They are often interchangeable though."

    "Right at the beginning of this unit we described strings as sequences of characters. This suggests that we can get at either the individual characters of a string or at substrings i.e. just some of the characters. Quick aside - variables that can be sub-divided are referred to as *non-scalar* variables. String **slicing** provides the mechanism by which we can sub-divide strings. Each individual character in a string can be referred to by its place in the string. We count the individual characters starting at zero. Why do we start at zero, that's silly?! Well there are good reasons you can read about [here](http://gestaltrevision.be/wiki/python/zerobased). For now best just accept it and move on. Many other programming languages also start counting at zero but some (e.g. [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) - Iain's other weapon of choice - start at 1). The take home message is that we start counting the letters in a string (or values in any other object) at zero in python.\n",

This will become more apparent in a moment.\n",

    "\n",
    "e.g. ```my_string.upper()```\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods can be listed using the ```dir()``` function e.g. ```dir(my_string)``` so you can see what's available for a particular data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get help on these using e.g. ```help(my_string.strip)``` where we use the ```help``` function putting the specific method we want help on in parentheses after ```help```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other *functions* in python can act on many object types. ```len``` was the example we showed. These are applied by placing the object you want the function to act on in parentheses after the function name e.g. ```len(my_string)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again you can get help on these using the ```help``` function e.g. ```help(len)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since strings are sequences python can get at the individual components. Counting the individual components starts at zero and all of the sequence data types in python (as we'll see) are indexed using a square bracket notation (e.g. ```my_string[1]```). Ranges can be defined for *slicing* using a colon. This slicing is inclusive at the lower bound but not at the higher bound so ```my_string[0:3]``` will return elements 0, 1 and 2 of the ```my_string``` variable. This can be further shortened to ```my_string[:3]``` if we want to go from the start whilst ```my_string[3:]``` will go from element [3] to the end of the sequence.\n",

You can carry out simple arithmetic with numbers using the standard arithmetic operators $+, -, *, /$. In addition python provides an operator for exponents ($**$) and for the modulo (// - return only the quotient from a division). Complex arithmetic procedures are best broken up using brackets to ensure the correct order of operations. Python obeys the standard order of operations for arithmetic. Just like text there are some ```methods``` that are specific to numbers and each number type has specific ```methods```. These can be accessed using the ```dir``` function."

    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this document I've been referring to variables without any explanation. So what are variables and why are they useful? In programming variables have the same purpose they serve in algebra - they are placeholders for some value. That value may stay constant or it may change. The use of the variable means we can refer to the variable and not have to independently keep track of the exact value. Variables have three important attributes - name, type and value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *name* of the variable is the label we, the programmers, give it. It's important to give your variables informative names. If you've written a program and left the code for a while it's really difficult to come back to it and remember what a bunch of variables called ```a```, ```a1```, ```r```, ```t1``` etc are accounting for or how they're being changed. Imagine you're writing a small utility program to convert degrees Celsius to degrees Farenheit (and you will be soon). Far better to name your variables e.g. ```deg_c``` and ```deg_f``` than ```value1``` and ```value2```. The former variable names immediately give you some idea of what those variables refer to. The latter names are pretty anonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second attribute of a variable is the *type* and we have discussed that above for ```str```, ```int``` and ```float``` (whilst touching on ```long``` and ```complex```). There is another basic type in python and that is the ```bool``` or Boolean value. We'll talk about those in a future unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have the *value* itself. This is the information the variable points to or contains (technically the variable points to a specific place in computer memory). The value and the type are closely related and a variable of a certain type can only contain certain values. However as the program runs the variable may change type (e.g. from a ```str``` to an ```int``` and you'll write such programs as we go on).\n",
    "\n",
    "One final attribute of variables worth touching on is *scope*. This is, in some sense, where the variable can be seen from by python. We'll talk more about this when we talk about writing our own functions (instead of relying on the in-built python ones). For now you can let the idea of scope percolate in your brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we link a variable name to its value and type? Well, we've already been doing that with the '=' sign. Once we've assigned a piece of information a name python automatically assigns the variable type for us - which is nice! Let's break down a variable assignment."
