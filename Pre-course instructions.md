# Pre-course instructions
In this short course on programming for data analysis we’ll be using the Python programming language. All programming languages come as the basic language and a bunch of modules/libraries that extend the language and make it easier to use (easier is a relative term here - but python is pretty easy).
## Installing the Anaconda python distribution
The easiest way to get python up and running on your system is to install a ‘pre-packaged’ version that comes with bells and whistles. We’ll use the Anaconda Python distribution.

Follow this link to the download page:

http://continuum.io/downloads

You should be offered the appropriate package for your system (mac or pc - if you’re using  linux I assume you mostly know what you’re doing and you’ll have python already on your system anyway).

Select the graphical installer for Python 2.7 (not Python 3.4).

Download and follow the prompts to install.

After you’ve installed you should have an icon somewhere for the Launcher. Launch this and install any updates required.

Finally launch the ipython-notebook which will open in your browser and click new (top right hand corner). In the first empty empty cel type:
```
print “Success”
```
Press the play button at the top of the notebook and you should see the word “Success” printed. If so, good… you can close the notebook and the terminal (if it’s open press the Ctrl key and the c key at the same time twice then close the terminal)!

If this hasn't worked we’ll hopefully deal with it when the course starts.

## Installing the Atom text editor
The other piece of software you need to install is the atom text editor. You can find this at:

https://atom.io/

Download the required package and install. Easy peasy - except you might need to turn off your anti-virus software (temporarily!) to get atom to install. Once installed you'll find atom in a 'Github Inc' folder in your Windows start menu or in the Applications folder on a mac.

## Folder setup

It will help to set up a folder/directory for the course. So somewhere on your hard drive create a folder called e.g. python_course or something equally imaginative. We’ll use that to store the data we’ll deal with during the course.

If you'd like to try out both python and Atom then click [here](https://github.com/iaingallagher/BasicPython/blob/master/Week1%20-%20Getting%20started.ipynb) to be taken to a simple exercise to give you a look at using python, the ipython notebook (more about that during the course) and Atom.
