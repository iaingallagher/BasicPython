If you haven't done this already then see the [pre course instructions](https://github.com/iaingallagher/BasicPython/blob/master/Pre-course%20instructions.md).  In this short example we'll show you some very basic moves with python. In the grand tradition of basic programming tutorials everywhere we'll start with a ```Hello World!``` programme. \n",

We'll see some of these as the course progresses. In particular Anaconda builds on a combination of python and extras called [IPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython). Anaconda takes IPython and adds even more. The bundling of the python language with the extras is called a *distribution* (hence Anaconda python distribution)."
