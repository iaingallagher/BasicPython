If you haven't done this already then see the [pre course instructions](https://gitlab.com/iaingallagher/BasicPython/blob/master/Week1%20-%20Getting%20started.ipynb).  In this short example we'll show you some very basic moves with python. In the grand tradition of basic programming tutorials everywhere we'll start with a ```Hello World!``` programme. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst we're using python as the programming language in this course the Anaconda version of python comes with a bunch of extras that help us carry out various tasks. We'll see some of these as the course progresses. In particular Anaconda builds on a combination of python and extras called [IPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython). Anaconda takes IPython and adds even more. The bundling of the python language with the extras is called a *distribution* (hence Anaconda python distribution)."
