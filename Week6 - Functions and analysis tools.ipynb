In the last unit we wrote a script to calculate BMI. If we wanted to incorporate a BMI calculation into other programmes we were writing we could copy the previous code. A much better approach wuld be to write a function that will automate this calculation and then use that in the new programme. Then, if things change you only have to change the function and not the other parts of your programme.\n",

An implementation is a way of performing a computation and some implementations are more optimal than others. In the suggestion above using the ```dict``` we don’t have to create room for all 26 letters (some might not appear in the string at all) - we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\n",

The most useful feature of ```DataFrames``` is that each column can contain a different type of data e.g. one column could contain text (i.e. words), another can contain ```ints```, another could contain ```booleans``` and yet another ```floats```. This approach makes handling data much easier than maintaining separate lists or lists of lists. To construct a ```DataFrame``` by hand we can use a ```dict``` object where each key in the ```dict``` indexes a ```list```."

The data we'll use are a set of marathon winning times for the years 1970 to 2000 for men and women. The original dataset is available (along with many others) at the [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) website. These data are in a ```csv``` file and we'll read that into a ```pandas``` DataFrame object using the [```read_csv```](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.io.parsers.read_csv.html) function. Then we'll examine the first 5 rows of the data to make sure it looks ok using the ```head()``` method on our DataFrame."
