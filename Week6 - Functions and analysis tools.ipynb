In the last unit we wrote a script to calculate BMI. If we wanted to incorporate a BMI calculation into other programmes we were writing we could copy the previous code. A much better approach wuld be to write a function that will automate this calculation and then use that in the new programme. Then, if things change you only have to change the function and not the other parts of your programme.\n",

An implementation is a way of performing a computation and some implementations are more optimal than others.

    "The ```Dataframe``` object is like a single sheet from a spreadsheet. It has two dimensions - rows and columns. The most useful feature of ```DataFrames``` is that each column can contain a different type of data e.g. one column could contain text (i.e. strings), another can contain ```ints```, another could contain ```booleans``` and yet another ```floats```. This approach makes handling data much easier than maintaining separate lists or lists of lists. To construct a ```DataFrame``` by hand we can use a ```dict``` object where each key in the ```dict``` indexes a ```list```."
