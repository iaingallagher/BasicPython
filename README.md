# BasicPython
This repo contains the jupyter notebooks and data for a course on basic python and data analysis. The course is run at the University of Stirling for Sport and Exercise Science students. The course runs over 12 weeks and for the first 8 these jupyter notebooks are used to introduce basic programming concepts and some python tools for data analysis. The last few weeks are project work for assessment.
